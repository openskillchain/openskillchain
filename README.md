# OpenSkillChain

This project idea arises from the need to solve the problem of non-certified training and education. Its purpose is to validate the training and work path of each individual with digital tools such as the BlockChain. It is aimed at students, entrepreneurs of all levels, recruitment agencies, human resources managers, training companies, and all those who need to evaluate the real level of preparation of an individual, regardless of the paper Curriculum. The certification will be based on a valid and certified path, where you can draw all the information relating to the courses attended, but above all the level of experience acquired, and be able to evaluate the individual (the candidate for a potential job) also through the evaluation of "Soft Skills". A technology that is capable not only of certifying and ensuring unequivocal information but also of returning an evaluation score, taking into consideration several metrics both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The final goal is to work at an "OPEN" distribution model in order to try to create a standard for the sector.

## The challenges

There are two main challenges we want to address. Primarily we want to be able to guarantee the security of the information traced in BlockChain, studying a model for acquiring the information source to ensure that it is certain and irrefutable. To achieve this it is necessary to develop a protocol that involves all those entities concerned with the training chain. The second goal is to develop decision support algorithms capable of translating the information distributed into a valid tool for the evaluation of individuals. To set this we will develop and publish a software architecture for the development of a proof of concept platform. This last step is also intended as a starting point for the further project stages.
